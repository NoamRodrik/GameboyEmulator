## RodrikGameboyEmulator
My own version of the Gameboy emulator, for education purposes only!
Written in modern C++ (stdc++17), with design patterns and a proper
structure of the gameboy internals.

Feel free to add/remove/change/ask anything you like.
This is a learning process for me and is entirely open source.

If there's anything (copyright related) that you want me to remove,
please contact me, and i'll do so.
